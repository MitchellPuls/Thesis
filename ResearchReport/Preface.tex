This report is a representation of the hard times through my study. It is the product of my ups and downs. Without the support of my teachers at the Amsterdam University of Applied Science, I would not be here where I am now. I would like to thank Dr. Marten Teitsma for giving me the opportunity to perform this research, Heiko van der Heijden for the support during the project, and my friends and family for dealing with me during this semester.\\~\\
I dedicate this thesis in particular to my girlfriend Julia Klu{\ss}meier, who was at the forefront of most of my stress during this period.\\~\\
