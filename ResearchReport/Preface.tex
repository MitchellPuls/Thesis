This report is a representation of the hard times through my study. It is the product of my ups and downs. Without the support of my teachers at the Amsterdam University of Applied Science, I would not be here where I am now, but by foremost I would like to dedicate this report to my girlfriend Julia Klu{\ss}meier. Who for the last two years was at the forefront of all my stress and frustrations.\\~\\
